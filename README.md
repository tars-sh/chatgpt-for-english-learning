2. Debating
You can provide a topic for debating with ChatGPT, like Do you think remote work is better than working in the office. You can choose one side and let ChatGPT stand on the other side. Then you can give your reason of why you're right, and why he's wrong.

3. Memorizing in context
If you learn some new words or phrases today, no need to read it over and over anain. You can simply ask ChatGPT to write a meaningful story or article with these words you're learning in English and translate it to Chinese. Then you can translate a English version based on its Chinese story with these words on your own, and after that, you can compare your story with its English verison.

4. Writing practice
Let ChatGPT generate a framework of an article based on the title provided by yourself, then you can write a article followed this framework. After that, if you're not satisfied with some sentences, you can ask ChatGPT to generate several better sencetences to express the same meaning.

5. Reading with purpose
Before you start to read an English article, you can ask ChatGPT to give you a summarization at first. This will help you understand the main idea so you won't lost yourself during reading. Also you can ask ChatGPT to generate some questions before and after. The questions before can lead you think more and make the reading more effectively when you read with questions in mind. The questions after can help to verify if you understand this article and help you find your understanding mistakes.

6. Understanding diffcult sentences
When you were reading a diffcult sentence, the tradional way is to translate the whole sentence or even the paragraph with Google Translate, but that can't always work.
